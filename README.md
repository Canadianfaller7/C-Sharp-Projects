# C# Projects
These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

## Projects:
 * [News Letter App](https://github.com/Canadianfaller7/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/master/NewsLetterAppMVC/ "Named link title")
 * [BlackJack](https://github.com/Canadianfaller7/BlackJack/ "Named link title")
 * [Car Insurance](https://github.com/Canadianfaller7/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/master/CarInsurance/ "Named link title")
 * And many more!

## News Letter
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a News Letter website where you can sign up to get news letter emails and this information will be saved to a Database. If the user no longer wants to receive emails from the News Letter then they may request to unsubscribe where the Admin Page will be able to do so and this will then fill in part of the database stating the user no longer wants to get emails and will remove their info from the admin page.

## BlackJack
This is a console app made using .NET Framework and C# for a good old game of BlackJack! This game uses classes(public and private), lambda functions and more to create a fun game for you to play against a dealer and to earn some money! Feel free to copy this and give it a try!

## Car Insrance 
This is another MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes users input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logit. Then the user info and their quote will be returned to the admin page and there the admin can make updates to the users policy and give them their final quote.
